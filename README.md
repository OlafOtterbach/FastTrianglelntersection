# The Fast Triangle Intersection Check

Olaf Otterbach, 11.11.2023

Function for fast testing whether two triangles intersect eachother.
Based on the algorithm from the paper 

"A Fast Triangle-Triangle Intersection Test"

by Thomas Möller.

The method is the basis for a collision test between two
bodies consisting of surfaces, which in turn are composed of triangles.
